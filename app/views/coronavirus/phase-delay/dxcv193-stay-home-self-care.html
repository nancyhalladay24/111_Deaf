    How to look after your symptoms at home
  </h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      rest and drink plenty of fluids
    </li>
    <li>
      take paracetamol or ibuprofen
    </li>
    <li>
      cover the mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing
    </li>
    <li>
      put used tissues in a bin
    </li>
    <li>
      wash your hands regularly with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you feel you canâ€™t cope with your symptoms at home or your condition gets
    worse use the 111 online service again.
  </p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">
    When to end your stay at home
  </h2>

  <p>
    You should remain at home until 7 days after your symptoms started.
  </p>
  <p>
    After 7 days, if you feel better and no longer have a high temperature, you
    can go back to doing what you would normally do.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cough may go on for some weeks in some people, even though the coronavirus
    infection has cleared. A cough by itself does not mean you have to stay at
    home for more than 7 days.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not get better after 7 days use the 111 online assessment
    service again before you leave your home or let visitors in.
  </p>
