    Information for people who work in healthcare settings
  </h3>
  <p>
    Healthcare workers include clinical, admin and social care staff.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can continue to go to work as normal if you have no symptoms, <strong>unless
    you have been in any healthcare setting in the country you visited,</strong>
    in which case you should self-isolate for 14 days.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What is self-isolation?</summary>
    <div>
      <p>
        This means you should:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          stay at home
        </li>
        <li>
          not go to work, school or public places
        </li>
        <li>
          not use public transport or taxis
        </li>
        <li>
          ask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands
          for you
        </li>
        <li>
          try to avoid visitors to your home – it's OK for friends, family or
          delivery drivers to drop off food
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is to help reduce the possible spread of infection.

    If you develop symptoms you must tell your line manager and your occupational
    health department, as well as calling 111.
