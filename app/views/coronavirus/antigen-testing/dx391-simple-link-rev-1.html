    How long to isolate for and managing symptoms at home
  </h2>

  <p>
    Self-isolation is for people with symptoms. It is different to staying at
    home and social distancing, which is for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    NHS.UK has information to help if you have symptoms. You can find out:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="#">how long to isolate for</a> if you or someone you live with has symptoms
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">how to look after yourself</a> and manage your symptoms at home
    </li>
  </ul>

      Get tested for coronavirus
    </h2>
    <p>
      The test will show whether you have the virus now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s done by either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        going to a drive-through testing centre if you have a car (you can’t get a
        taxi)
      </li>
      <li>
        getting a home test kit sent to you
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Key workers are being given priority at the moment, but anyone with symptoms
      can apply. If you can’t get one straightaway you should continue to check.
