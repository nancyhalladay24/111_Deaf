  <h1>Book a call with a 111 nurse now</h1>

  <p>
    A nurse needs to speak to you so we can get you the right help.
    <br>When you book a call, the 111 nurse will:
    <ul>
      <li>know what you've answered so far</li>
      <li>advise you what to do next</li>
      <li>book an appointment for you if you need one</li>
      <li>use text relay or a BSL interpreter If you have difficulty hearing and would like them to. </li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't book a call and just ring 111 you will have to start again from the beginning.
  </p>
  <div class="callout callout--info">
    <p>You should get a call within 20 minutes. It's important that you wait to spek to the nurse.</p>
