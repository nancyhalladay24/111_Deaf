  <h1>Why we need your details</h1>

  <p>
    Sending your phone number, name and home postcode helps the pharmacist find your NHS number.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they'll know who you are you'll pay standard NHS charges. If you're exempt you won't pay. </p>
      <p>
        You might be asked to show some identification when yu get there.
  </p>
  <h3>Contacting them before you go</h3>
  <p>
  If you phone them before you go they'll tell you:
  <ul>
    <li>if they're able to give you the medicine</li>
    <li>if they have it in stock</li>
    <li>what to do if they can't help</li>
    </ul>
    If you don't contact or go to the pharmacy they'll have to phone you to make sure you're OK.
