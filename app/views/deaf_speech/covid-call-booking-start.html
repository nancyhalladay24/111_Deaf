  <h1>Book a call with a 111 nurse</h1>

  <p>
    A nurse from the COVID clinical response service needs to speak to you.</p>
    <p>Deaf people can book a text relay call.</p>
    <p>When you book a call, the 111 nurse will:
    <ul>
      <li>know what you've answered so far</li>
      <li>ask you some more questions about your symptoms and current health</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    It's important that you speak to the nurse. You should get a call within 2 hours. The 111 phone service is busy, so it could take longer than usual.
