This privacy notice supplements the other notices and is not intended to override them.</p>

<h3>CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY NOTICE AND YOUR DUTY TO INFORM US OF CHANGES</h3>

<p>This version was last updated in October 2019.</p>

<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>

<h3>THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h3>

<p>This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.</p>


<h2 id="data">2. THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>

<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
<p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together, as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes name, gender, date of birth, address, telephone number, email, optional NHS number.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes email address and telephone numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Data</strong> includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.</li>
    <li><strong>Special Categories of Data</strong> includes sensitive medical details such as symptoms, conditions, biometrics, family history, medication and any other health data you provide to us by filling the form on the website.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> includes information about how you use our website, products and services.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also collect, use and share <strong>Aggregated Data</strong> such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does <strong>not</strong> directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>

<p>Please note that if you access our service using your NHS login details, the identity verification services are managed by NHS Digital. NHS Digital is the controller for any personal information you provided to NHS Digital to get an NHS login account and verify your identity, and uses that personal information solely for that single purpose. For this personal information, our role is a “processor” only and we must act under the instructions provided by NHS Digital (as the “controller”) when verifying your identity. To see NHS Digital’s Privacy Notice and Terms and Conditions, please <a href="https://account.login.nhs.uk/#/account/termsofuse/privacynotice" target="_blank">click here</a>. This restriction does not apply to the personal information you provide to us separately.</p>

<h3>IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA</h3>

<p>Where we need to collect personal data in order for the information to be forwarded via the eConsult website to the GP practice you have chosen and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to send the information to the GP practice.  This does not affect your ability and freedom to visit your medical practitioner.</p>


<h2 id="collection">3. HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED?</h2>

<p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Direct interactions</strong>. You may give us your Identity, Contact and Special Categories of Data by filling in forms or by <strong>Automated technologies or interactions</strong>. As you interact with our website, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies. Please see our <a href="#cookies">cookie policy</a> for further details.</li>
    <li><strong>Third parties or publicly available sources</strong>. We may receive personal data about you from various third parties and public sources as set out below such as Survey Gizmo, if you have chosen to take the optional survey we send you.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="use">4. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>

<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
    <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
    <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
    <li>Where you provide your consent (when using our website)</li>
</ol>

<p>Click <a href="#glossary">here</a> to find out more about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal data.</p>
<p>In relation to <strong>Special Category of Data</strong>, we rely on your explicit consent.
In order to operate the website and online consultation, we use <strong>profiling and automated decision making tools</strong>. Further information on the use of automated decision making and profiling can be found by clicking <a href="#automatedDecisionMaking">here</a>.</p>

<h3>PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE WILL USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>

<p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.</p>
<p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@webgp.com" target="_blank">privacy@webgp.com</a> if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.</p>

<h3 id="automatedDecisionMaking">AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING AND PROFILING</h3>

<p>The Identity Data, Contact Data and Special Category of Data you provide to us are used to determine whether you should seek more urgent care or be put in contact with a GP, using automated decision making and profiling technology. The profiling and automated decision making are based on a number of criteria developed with medical doctors and are updated on a regular basis in line with medical developments.  If you require more information on the profiling and automated decision making, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@webgp.com" target="_blank">privacy@webgp.com</a>.</p>

<p>This profiling and automated decision making does not have a legal or other significant effect on you as, irrespective of the outcome of such profiling and automated decision making, you are free to visit your GP for a consultation. You can also fill in another form to provide different, updated information on the website and you can also speak to your GP and provide them with any information.</p>

<h3>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</h3>

<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@webgp.com" target="_blank">privacy@webgp.com</a>.</p>

<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>

<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>


<h2 id="disclosures">5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>

<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</p>

<ol>
    <li>External Third Parties as set out in the <a href="#glossary">Glossary</a>.</li>
    <li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>
</ol>

<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>


<h2 id="international">6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>

<p>We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>


<h2 id="security">7. DATA SECURITY</h2>

<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>


<h2 id="retention">8. DATA RETENTION</h2>

<h3>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</h3>

<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

</ol>

<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please <a href="mailto:privacy@webgp.com" target="_blank">contact us at privacy@webgp.com</a>.</p>

<h3>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</h3>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

<h3>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h3>

<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

<h3>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</h3>

<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>


<h2 id="glossary">10. GLOSSARY</h2>

<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>

<p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by <a href="mailto:privacy@webgp.com" target="_blank">contacting us at privacy@webgp.com</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>

<p><strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>

<p><strong>Consent</strong> means a consent you have provided for the particular processing activity.</p>

<p>Explicit Consent means a consent you have provided explicitly for the particular processing activity relating to Special Categories of Data.</p>

<h3>THIRD PARTIES</h3>

<h3>EXTERNAL THIRD PARTIES</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Service providers acting as processors based in the EU who provide IT and system administration services, such as Advanced Health and Care Limited, trading as Advanced or Docman.</li>
    <li>GP practice (chosen by you) acting as a controller who will receive the online consultation form you fill in on our website, unless we recommend that you go to seek more urgent care. The GP practice may have an extended practice network that they decide to share the consultation with. Please refer to your GP practice privacy notice for further detail.</li>
    <li>Please note that the information you provide on this website is sent to the GP practice (which may be via Advanced, a third party hosting provider) that YOU have selected.  We are not responsible if you select a practice that you are not registered with as a patient and/or if, as a result, you do not get a response from that practice.  We are not responsible either for any delay or lack of response by the practice you have selected. If your GP practice fails to retrieve your data from Advanced, Advanced will contact the practice.</li>
    <li>Email service provider, who will send confirmation emails to you (identity, contact, profile, special categories of data)</li>
    <li>Third party survey providers, such as Survey Gizmo</li>
</ol>

<h3>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>

<p>You have the right to:</p>

<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>

<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>

<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>

<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>

<p><strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>

<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>

<p><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
